# Features

The website comprises two pages: the login page, where you can read the game rules, create your username, and start the game, and the game page, where you can actually begin playing the memory game. On this page, you can view your player name and also check your timer.

## Login Page

## Game Page
The game page comprises a total of 20 cards, each strategically adorned with images of selected animals. This deliberate choice is intended to facilitate easy memorization upon flipping, thus directing the user's experience towards the singular objective of identifying the corresponding pair positions.

# Typography
The website utilizes a singular font, specifically Kanit from Google Fonts, maintaining a uniform and cohesive typographic style.

# Deployment

The website is currently hosted on GitHub Pages and is deployed directly from the master branch. Automatic updates to the deployed site are triggered with each new commit to the main branch. It is crucial to name the landing page as index.html for proper deployment on GitHub Pages.

To deploy the page on GitHub Pages from its corresponding repository, the following steps were undertaken:

- Login or Sign Up to GitHub.
- Navigate to the project repository.
- Access Settings from the top menu.
- Select "Pages" from the left-hand navigation panel.
- In the "Source" section, opt for the branch to deploy (Main for newer repositories, Master for older ones).
- Choose the deployment folder, typically "/root".
- Click "Save" and patiently await the completion of the deployment process.
- The URL will be displayed above the "Source" section.

# Run locally
### Fork:

- Open the project repository.
- Click the Fork button in the top right corner.

### Clone:
- Login or Sign Up to GitHub.
- Open the project repository.
- Click on the "Code" button, choose your preferred cloning method (HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI), and copy the provided link.
- Open your preferred code editor's terminal and navigate to the desired location for the cloned directory.
- Type 'git clone' in the terminal, paste the link from step 3, and press enter.

# Testing
The website is crafted for seamless operation, ensuring users can effortlessly accomplish their objectives. Chrome development tools were employed to identify and rectify any issues that arose during the development phase. Performance testing was systematically conducted, incorporating both manual assessments and automated methods.


### I know that the playability test was successful because when two identical cards are clicked, they are flipped over and removed from the game.
